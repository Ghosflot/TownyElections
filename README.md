# TownyElections ðŸ—³

#### Towny is too authoritarian, so why not let players choose their leaders?

TownyElections allows players to choose leaders for their towns and nations, voting for parties and creating their own ones.

## About the project ðŸ—º

After years of playing Towny in geopolitical and roleplaying servers I always missed politics and diplomacy, which could not be done properly as the leader of a nation/town had always all the power. So I started doing tests on my Minecraft server with elections (just for towns at that moment), and given how much players enjoyed it I decided to make it a full working plugin.

The goal of TownyElections is becoming an expansion for Towny, with elections, parties, political systems and diplomacy, suitable for all kinds of survival and roleplaying servers.
